# Hilt Basics
I will be making video lectures using the gists below as examples. 

1. Preparing to use Hilt
	- Follow the setup procedure:
		- https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/e5e9b476764cdb7b139a14cb642325b0
2. Field injecting a class with no dependencies. You own that class.
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/130b29cf33696fc02710df3f7aba8152
3. Scopes and the "tier-like" system
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/7cdf070b5a0575aed4970fb3258f25e9
4. Dependencies that require dependencies (Concrete classes that you own)
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/fd5a5a4e17700ce23724245d500ebdbd
5. Some things can't be constructor-injected. What is the solution?
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/9d88bce861d1cfc21d590819781ff6e1
6. Hilt Modules, Binds and Provides
	- https://gist.github.com/mitchtabian/d06ee1d6445265adf00b087fc56708d8
	- Teach in this order:
		1. ComplexMethod_VALID.kt
		2. ComplexMethod_INVALID.kt
		3. SimpleMethod.kt
7. Multiple Bindings of the same type
